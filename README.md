# hyprplus
Project Hyprplus is bringing Hyprland packages (Hyprland and its dependencies) to Debian in the form of native .deb packages

All code is taken, and modified, from PikaOS' [Git repository](https://git.pika-os.com/explore/repos). Big thanks to them.

The project will be the base for [Repologist](https://worktree.ca/meowniverse/repologist).
